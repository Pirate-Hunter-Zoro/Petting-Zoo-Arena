# Full PPO Training Update Process (Multi-Agent Version)

---

## 💡 High-Level Summary

**Each cycle in PPO training:**

1. **Collect experience** from all agents.
2. **Store** all experiences into a shared buffer.
3. **After batch is full**, run **PPO policy update**:
   - Improve the Actor (Policy) and Critic (Value Function).
4. **Clear buffer** and repeat the process.

## 📊 Mid-Level Breakdown

### Rollout Phase
- Collect (state, action, reward, done) for every agent.
- Store all agents' data into a giant shared buffer.

### PPO Update Phase
- Extract (states, actions, old log_probs, returns, advantages).
- Detach tensors from computation graph.
- For several epochs:
  - Shuffle data.
  - Split into mini-batches.
  - For each mini-batch:
    - Forward pass through policy.
    - Build action distribution.
    - Compute new log_probs, entropy.
    - Compute importance sampling ratios.
    - Compute clipped surrogate actor loss.
    - Compute value (critic) loss.
    - Combine total loss: actor + vf_coef * critic - ent_coef * entropy.
    - Backpropagate and optimizer.step().

## 🌊 Specific Code-to-Concept Map

| Code | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| `states, actions, log_probs_old, returns, advantages = buffer.get()` | Pull rollout data |
| `detach()` on tensors | Freeze rollout graphs |
| `for _ in range(epochs)` | Multiple update passes |
| `torch.randperm` | Shuffle dataset |
| Forward pass | Predict logits and values |
| Create `Categorical` | Build action distribution |
| `log_prob` | New probabilities of taken actions |
| `ratios = exp(new_log_probs - old_log_probs)` | Importance sampling |
| `actor_loss` | Conservative policy improvement loss |
| `value_loss` | Critic loss (MSE) |
| `loss.backward(); optimizer.step()` | Update network weights |
